    "**It provides a clear modular structure for programs which makes it good for defining abstract datatypes in which implementation details are hidden.**\n",
    "### 2. Code Reusability:\n",
    "**Objects can also be reused within an across applications. The reuse of software also lowers the cost of development. More effort is put into the object-oriented analysis and design, which lowers the overall cost of development.**\n",
    "### 3.Easier to Maintain:\n",
    "**It makes software easier to maintain. Since the design is modular, part of the system can be updated in case of issues without a need to make large-scale changes**\n",
    " ### 4.Faster Development:\n",
    "**Reuse also enables faster development. Object-oriented programming languages come with rich libraries of objects, and code developed during projects is also reusable in future projects**\n",
    "### 5.Easier to Test:\n",
    " **Programmes written in OOP technique are marginally easier to test, manage as well as maintain.**\n",
    "### 6.Secured:\n",
    "**It is a secured development technique since data is hidden and canâ€™t be accessed by external functions.**\n",
    "### 7.Real World Entities:\n",
    "**Since everything is treated as objects, so we can model a real-world concept using OOP.**\n",
    "### 8. Polymorphism :\n",
    "**It is another feature of the object oriented programming. Polymorphism simply means that a function has many forms.**\n",
    "### 9.Inheritance: \n",
    "**We know that OOPS Provide Inheritance with the Help of the Inheritance The Code that is Previously Code  is used in many Places where we wants  By using the Inheritance We can Create our Programs by using pre-defined code.**"

    "**Objects are the basic run-time entities in an object-oriented system. Programming problem is analyzed in terms of objects and nature of communication between them. When a program is executed, objects interact with each other by sending messages. Different objects can also interact with each other without knowing the details of their data or code.**\n",
    "## 3.Attribute:\n",
    "**In Object-oriented programming(OOP), classes and objects have attributes. Attributes are data stored inside a class or instance and represent the state or quality of the class or instance. In short, attributes store information about the instance. Also, attributes should not be confused with class functions also known as methods. One can think of attributes as noun or adjective, while methods are the verb of the class.\n",
